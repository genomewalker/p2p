  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Sequence similarity searching is a very important bioinformatics
	task. While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) outperforms
	exact methods through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current
	BLAST software is suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences.
	There are also some shortcomings in the user-interface of the current
	command-line applications.RESULTS:We describe features and improvements
	of rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line applications.
	Long query sequences are broken into chunks for processing, in some
	cases leading to dramatically shorter run times. For long database
	sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts of
	the sequence, reducing CPU time and memory usage for searches of
	short queries against databases of contigs or chromosomes. The program
	can now retrieve masking information for database sequences from
	the BLAST databases. A new modular software library can now access
	subject sequence data from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several
	new features, including strategy files that allow a user to save
	and reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be
	uploaded to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site.CONCLUSION:The
	new BLAST command-line applications, compared to the current BLAST
	tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries
	as well as chromosome length database sequences. We have also improved
	the user interface of the command-line applications.},

  abstract = {<p>Due to its extreme salinity and high Mg concentration the Dead
	Sea is characterized by a very low density of cells most of which
	are Archaea. We discovered several underwater fresh to brackish water
	springs in the Dead Sea harboring dense microbial communities. We
	provide the first characterization of these communities, discuss
	their possible origin, hydrochemical environment, energetic resources
	and the putative biogeochemical pathways they are mediating. Pyrosequencing
	of the 16S rRNA gene and community fingerprinting methods showed
	that the spring community originates from the Dead Sea sediments
	and not from the aquifer. Furthermore, it suggested that there is
	a dense Archaeal community in the shoreline pore water of the lake.
	Sequences of bacterial sulfate reducers, nitrifiers iron oxidizers
	and iron reducers were identified as well. Analysis of white and
	green biofilms suggested that sulfide oxidation through chemolitotrophy
	and phototrophy is highly significant. Hyperspectral analysis showed
	a tight association between abundant green sulfur bacteria and cyanobacteria
	in the green biofilms. Together, our findings show that the Dead
	Sea floor harbors diverse microbial communities, part of which is
	not known from other hypersaline environments. Analysis of the water’s
	chemistry shows evidence of microbial activity along the path and
	suggests that the springs supply nitrogen, phosphorus and organic
	matter to the microbial communities in the Dead Sea. The underwater
	springs are a newly recognized water source for the Dead Sea. Their
	input of microorganisms and nutrients needs to be considered in the
	assessment of possible impact of dilution events of the lake surface
	waters, such as those that will occur in the future due to the intended
	establishment of the Red Sea−Dead Sea water conduit.</p>},

	primers and 512 primer pairs were evaluated in silico with respect
	to the SILVA 16S/18S rDNA non-redundant reference dataset (SSURef
	108 NR). Based on this evaluation a selection of ‘best available’
	primer pairs for Bacteria and Archaea for three amplicon size classes
	(100–400, 400–1000, ≥1000 bp) is provided. The most promising bacterial
	primer pair (S-D-Bact-0341-b-S-17/S-D-Bact-0785-a-A-21), with an
	amplicon size of 464 bp, was experimentally evaluated by comparing
	the taxonomic distribution of the 16S rDNA amplicons with 16S rDNA
	fragments from directly sequenced metagenomes. The results of this

	Cd-hit-2d compares two protein datasets and reports similar matches

	cd-hit-est-2d compares two nucleotide datasets. All these programs
	can handle huge datasets with millions of sequences and can be hundreds
	of times faster than methods based on the popular sequence comparison

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2011},
  volume = {12},
  pages = {385},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND:A critical output of metagenomic studies is the estimation
	of abundances of taxonomical or functional groups. The inherent uncertainty
	in assignments to these groups makes it important to consider both
	their hierarchical contexts and their prediction confidence. The
	current tools for visualizing metagenomic data, however, omit or
	distort quantitative hierarchical relationships and lack the facility
	for displaying secondary variables.RESULTS:Here we present Krona,
	a new visualization tool that allows intuitive exploration of relative
	abundances and confidences within the complex hierarchies of metagenomic
	classifications. Krona combines a variant of radial, space-filling
	displays with parametric coloring and interactive polar-coordinate
	zooming. The HTML5 and JavaScript implementation enables fully interactive
	charts that can be explored with any modern Web browser, without
	the need for installed software or plug-ins. This Web-based architecture
	also allows each chart to be an independent document, making them
	easy to share via e-mail or post to a standard Web server. To illustrate
	Krona's utility, we describe its application to various metagenomic
	data sets and its compatibility with popular metagenomic analysis
	tools.CONCLUSIONS:Krona is both a powerful metagenomic visualization
	tool and a demonstration of the potential of HTML5 for highly accessible
	bioinformatic visualizations. Its rich and interactive displays facilitate
	more informed interpretations of metagenomic analyses, while its
	implementation as a browser-based application makes it extremely
	portable and easily adopted into existing analysis packages. Both
	the Krona rendering code and conversion tools are freely available
	under a BSD open-source license, and available from: http://krona.sourceforge.net

  title = {{SINA}: accurate high throughput multiple sequence alignment of ribosomal
	RNA genes},
  journal = {Bioinformatics},
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {Motivation: In the analysis of homologous sequences, computation of
	multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) has become a bottleneck. This
	is especially troublesome for marker genes like the ribosomal RNA
	(rRNA) where already millions of sequences are publicly available
	and individual studies can easily produce hundreds of thousands of
	new sequences. Methods have been developed to cope with such numbers,
	but further improvements are needed to meet accuracy requirements.Results:
	Here we present the SILVA Incremental Aligner (SINA) used to align
	the rRNA gene databases provided by the SILVA ribosomal RNA project.
	SINA employs a combination of k-mer searching and partial order alignment
	(POA) to maintain very high alignment accuracy while satisfying high
	throughput performance demands.SINA was evaluated in comparison with
	the commonly used high throughput MSA programs PyNAST and mothur.
	The three BRAli- Base III benchmark MSAs could be reproduced with
	99.3%, 97.6% and 96.1% accuracy. A larger benchmark MSA comprising
	38,772 sequences could be reproduced with 98.9% and 99.3% accuracy
	using reference MSAs comprising 1000 and 5000 sequences. SINA was
	able to achieve higher accuracy than PyNAST and mothur in all performed
	benchmarks.Availability: Alignment of up to 500 sequences using the
	latest SILVA SSU/LSU Ref data-sets as reference MSA is offered at
	http://www.arb-silva.de/aligner. This page also links to Linux binaries,
	user manual and tutorial. SINA is made available under a personal
	use license.Contact: epruesse@mpi-bremen.de},
